# Clifford Password Management

Ruby library for a password management application based on Clifford geometric algebra.

## Requirements

This code requires Ruby installed on your system. There are [several options for downloading and installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ "Download Ruby").

This project uses only Ruby standard libraries, so once you have Ruby installed (version 2.6.3 and greater), you have everything required to run the code. We tested our implementation on Mac OSX version 10.13.6 with ruby 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580) [x86_64-darwin17].
